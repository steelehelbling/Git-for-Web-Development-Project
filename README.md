This project consists of two parts:

## Part One:
You will need to follow the Lambda School Git Workflow to add a file to this project follow the steps below:

- [x] Create your own version of this repo - Fork
- [x] Add your TL as a collaborator
- [x] Clone this repo
- [x] Create a branch `git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'`
  - [x] Add a file to the project called `yourFirstName-yourLastName`.txt. This should contain the link to your completed codepen from part 2 as well as the review questions/answers
  - [x] Run your usual git commands for adding/committing and pushing **Be sure to push to your branch!**
- [x] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  - [x] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> master).
  - [x] Add your TL as a reviewer on the Pull-Request

Stretch Git Tasks
- [ ] While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. Independently research the following topics to learn more about Git.
  - [ ] Research and understand what a `merge conflict` is and how to resolve it.
  - [ ] Research the Git commands `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the master branch.
  - [ ] Research the Git commands `reset `, `revert`, `clean`. These commands will allow you to go back and amends previous commits you have made.

- [ ] Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console. 

- [ ] Research and setup SSH keys with GitHub, so that you do not need to input your username/password each time you push.
